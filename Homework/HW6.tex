\begin{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Per our formulas, we define capacitance as:

        $$C_{eff}=\frac{\varepsilon_r\varepsilon_oA}{d}$$

        We enter the given values to find:

        $$C_{eff}=\frac{4.5\cdot(8.85\cdot10^{-12}) \cdot120(10^{-2})^2}{1.5\cdot10^{-3}}$$

        This gives us:

        $$\boxed{C_{eff}=.3186[\si{\nano\farad}]}$$

      \item The energy of a capacitor is given by:

        $$E_C=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$

        We enter our given values and capacitance from (a) to get:

        $$E_C=\frac{1}{2}(.3186\cdot10^{-9})(500)^2$$
        $$\boxed{E_C=3.9825\cdot10^{-5}[\si{\joule}]}$$

      \item We can calculate the maximum voltage as:

        $$V=\frac{Ed}{\varepsilon_r}$$

        Using our values, we get:

        $$V=\frac{1}{4.5}(250\cdot10^{5})(1.5\cdot10^{-3})$$
        $$\boxed{V=8.33\bar{3}[\si{\kilo\volt}]}$$

      \item We know that the energy may also be expressed as:

        $$E_C=\frac{Q^2}{2C}$$

        Thus, we may calculate our charge quantity as:

        $$Q=\sqrt{(2)(.3186\cdot10^{-9})(3.9825\cdot10^{-5})}$$
        $$Q=1.593\cdot10^{-7}[\si{\coulomb}]$$

        We can then calculate the changed capacitance, since the dielectric is removed, which would imply $\varepsilon_r=1$:

        $$C\prime=\frac{\varepsilon_oA}{d}$$

        This gives us:

        $$C\prime=70.8[\si{\pico\farad}]$$

        We now recalculate the energy to see:

        $$E_C=\frac{(1.593\cdot10^{-7})^2}{2(70.8\cdot10^{-12})}$$
        $$\boxed{E_C=1.7921\cdot10^{-4}[\si{\joule}]}$$

        We can see that the energy is increased by a factor of $\varepsilon_r$, or, in this case, 4.5 times.

    \end{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item We may write the polarization as:

        $$P=\chi_e\varepsilon_oE$$

        Thus, we use our given values to write:

        $$P=(4)(8.85\cdot10^{-12})(4\cdot10^5)$$

        We solve to get:

        $$\boxed{P=1.416\cdot10^{-5}\left[ \si{\coulomb\over\square\meter} \right]}$$

      \item 

      \item 

    \end{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item We can write each given case as:

        $$\varepsilon_{r,1M}=2.8+\frac{4.5}{1+(.2)^2}$$
        $$\varepsilon_{r,5M}=2.8+\frac{4.5}{1+(1)^2}$$
        $$\varepsilon_{r,50M}=2.8+\frac{4.5}{1+(10)^2}$$

        This gives us:

        $$\boxed{\varepsilon_{r,1M}=7.1269}$$
        $$\boxed{\varepsilon_{r,5M}=5.05}$$
        $$\boxed{\varepsilon_{r,50M}=2.8446}$$

      \item We may observe that \underline{permittivity decreases as frequency increases}. Based on the capacitance formula, $C=\varepsilon A/d$, we know that capacitance is directly proportional to permittivity. Furthermore, we know that the frequency response of a capacitor is inversely proportional to frequency per $C=(j\omega Z)^{-1}$. As such, by extension we may conclude that \underline{permittivity is inversely proportional to frequency}.

      \item By incorporating this dielectric into high-frequency RF applications, we would need to \underline{account for the decreasing dielectric relative permittivity} with respect to frequency. Note that, one frequency is great enough, the relative permittivity remains fairly stable, just above 2.8.
