\begin{enumerate}

  \item Per our formula, we know:

    $$\mu_d=\frac{\sigma}{\eta e}=\frac{1}{\eta e\rho}$$

    To find $\eta$, we use:

    $$\eta=\frac{\rho N_A}{M_{at}}$$

    Also, we need to find $\rho$, or the resistivity at $22\left[ \si{\celsius} \right]$. As such, we get:

    $$\rho_{22}=\rho_o[1+\alpha(T-T_o)]$$

    Obtaining our values from a known value table, we get:

    $$\rho_{22}=2.44\cdot10^{-8}[1+.003715(22-20)]$$
    $$\rho_{22}=2.458\cdot10^{-8}\left[ \si{\ohm\meter} \right]$$

    We return to the electron concentration to get:

    $$\eta=\frac{2.458\cdot10^{-8}\cdot 6.022\cdot10^{23}}{196.67}$$
    $$\eta=590.96\cdot10^{26}\left[ \si{electron\over\meter\cubed} \right]$$

    Finally, we calculate the drift mobility:

    $$\mu_d=\frac{1}{590.96\cdot10^{26}\cdot1.6\cdot10^{-19}\cdot 2.458\cdot10^{-8}}$$
    $$\boxed{\mu_d=4.3027\cdot10^{-3}\left[ \si{\meter\squared\over\volt\second} \right]}$$

    Furthermore, with the given velocity, we may find the mean free path as:

    $$\lambda=\frac{\mu_d m_e\mu_V}{e}$$

    This gives us:

    $$\lambda=\frac{4.3027\cdot10^{-3}\cdot9.1\cdot10^{-31}\cdot1.4\cdot10^{6}}{1.6\cdot10^{-19}}$$
    $$\boxed{\lambda=3.426\cdot10^{-8}[\si{\meter}]}$$
