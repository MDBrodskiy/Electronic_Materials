\begin{itemize}

  \item Capacitance

    $$C=\frac{\varepsilon_r\varepsilon_oA}{d}$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $\varepsilon_o$ represents the permittivity of free space

      \item $\varepsilon_r$ is the permittivity of a dielectric material

      \item $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the plates

      \item $d$ is the distance between plates

      \item $C$ represents the effective capacitance

      \item Add in parallel, divide in series

    \end{itemize}

  \item Dielectric Strength

    \begin{itemize}

      \item When the electric field in the dielectric reaches a critical value called the dielectric strength, the medium suffers a dielectric breakdown where a large current flows across the plates

    \end{itemize}

  \item Dielectric Theory

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $p$ is the electric dipole moment (measure of electrostatic effect of opposite charges displaced by a): $p=Qa$

      \item Power dissipation in a capacitor occurs and is also frequency dependent

    \end{itemize}

  \item Polarizability

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Polarizability is defined as:

        $$p=\alpha E$$

      \item The induced dipole moment is called the electronic polarizability, $\alpha_e$

      \item The electronic polarization may be written as:

        $$p_e=\left( \frac{Z^2e^2}{\beta} \right)$$

      \item We can find susceptibility as:

        $$\chi_e=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_o}N\alpha_e$$

      \item The two are related through:

        $$\varepsilon_r=1+\chi_e$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Clausius-Mossotti Equation

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Taking:

        $$p=\alpha_eE$$
        $$P=\chi_e\varepsilon_oE$$
        $$\varepsilon_r=1+\chi_e$$

      \item We combine all of the relationships to get:

        $$\frac{\varepsilon_r-1}{\varepsilon_r+2}=\frac{N\alpha_e}{3\varepsilon_o}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Relaxation

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The rate of polarization change may be written as:

        $$\frac{dp}{dt}=-\frac{p}{\tau}+\frac{\alpha_d(o)}{\tau}E_oe^{j\omega t}$$

      \item We can solve to obtain:

        $$p=\alpha_d(\omega)E_oe^{j\omega t}$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
