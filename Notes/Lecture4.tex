\begin{itemize}

  \item Electron Sharing in Covalent Bonds

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration (octet rule)

      \item Key Characteristics

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Localized Electrons:

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Shared electrons are concentrated in the bond region between two nuclei

            \end{itemize}

          \item Directionality:

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Covalent bonds are directional, determining the geometry of molecules and latices

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Octet Rule

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Atoms tend to share, gain, or lose electrons to achieve a stable configuration with eight valence electron configuration

      \item Covalent bonding enables atoms to fulfill this rule by sharing electrons

      \item Exceptions to the Octet Rule

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Expanded Octets: Elements like phosphorus (P) or sulfur (S) can have more than eight valence electrons

          \item Electron Deficiency: Atoms have fewer than 8 electrons in their valence shell

          \item Deviations occur due to varying atomic size, electron configurations, or bonding needs

          \item Odd-Electron Molecules (Radicals): Molecules with unpaired electrons, resulting in an incomplete octet

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Bond Types

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Single: Longest bond length and lowest bond energy

      \item Double: Shorter and stronger than single bonds

      \item Triple: Shortest bond length and highest bond energy

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
