\begin{itemize}

  \item What is Ionic Bonding?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Ionic Bonding occurs when electrons are transferred from one atom to another, creating oppositely charged ions that attract each other

      \item Typically occurs between a metal (donates electrons) and a nonmetal (accepts electrons)

      \item How it happens:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Metal (like Sodium) loses an electron $\to$ forms a positively charged ion (Na$^+$)

          \item Nonmetal (like Chlorine) gains an electron$\to$ forms a negatively charged ion (CL$^-$)

          \item Attraction: electrostatic forces hold the ions together

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Role of Electronegativity

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A measure of an atom's ability to attract and hold electrons in a bond

      \item Higher electronegativity $\to$ stronger pull on electrons

      \item Electronegativity Difference

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Ionic bonding occurs when there is a large difference in electronegativity ($>1.7$) between two atoms

          \item Metal: Low electronegativity $\to$ tends to lose electrons (for example, sodium has an electronegativity of .9)

          \item Nonmetal: High electronegativity $\to$ tends to gain electrons (for example, chlorine has an electronegativity of 3.0)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Coulomb's Law

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Formula:

        $$\vec{F}=\frac{k|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $k$ is the Coulomb constant ($8.987\cdot10^9[\si{\newton\meter\per\coulomb\squared}]$)

          \item $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges on the ions

          \item $r$ is the ionic radius

          \item $F$ is the force between the two ions

        \end{itemize}

      \item Related to the lattice energy:

        $$E_L\propto \frac{k|q_1q_2|}{r}$$

      \item Explains the high melting points and stability of ionic solids

      \item Predicts relative strength of ionic compounds for different applications

    \end{itemize}

  \item Polyatomic Ions

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Groups of atoms covalently bonded together that act as a single charged unit; Examples:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Ammonium (NH$_4^+$): Acts as a cation

          \item Nitrate (NO$_3^-$): Acts as an anion

          \item Sulfate (SO$_4^{2-}$): Double negative charge

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item High Melting and Boiling Points

    \begin{itemize}
        
      \item Strong Electrostatic Force

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Ionic compounds are held together by strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions

          \item Overcoming these forces requires significant energy, resulting in high melting and boiling points

        \end{itemize}

      \item Lattice Structure and Stability

        \begin{itemize}

          \item 3D Crystal Lattice: tightly packed lattice structure maximizes attractions and minimizes repulsions, enhancing stability

          \item The lattice's stability translates into higher energy requirements for breaking bonds
        
        \end{itemize}

      \item Impact of Ionic Charge and Size

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Higher charges: Compounds with higher ionic charges have stronger attractions and higher melting/boiling points compared to singly charged ions

          \item Smaller ions: Smaller ionic radii allow ions to pack more closely, increasing bond strength and thermal stability

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Brittleness

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Nature of Ionic Bonds

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Ions in the crystal lattice are held in fixed positions by strong electrostatic forces

        \end{itemize}

      \item Response to Stress

        \begin{itemize}

          \item When force is applied, layers of ions shift relative to each other

          \item This causes like-charged ions to align, resulting in strong repulsive forces

          \item The repulsion causes the lattice to fracture

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Electrical Conductivity

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Conductivity in Different States

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Solid State

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in the solid state

              \item Reason: Ions are fixed in the crystal lattice and can not move freely

            \end{itemize}

          \item Molten or Dissolved State

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Ionic compounds conduct electricity when melted or dissolved in water

              \item Reason: Ions are free to move, allowing the flow of charge

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Solubility in Polar Solvents

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Ionic Compounds are Soluble in Polar Solvents

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Polar Nature of the Solvent

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Polar solvents like water have molecules with partial positive ($\delta+$) and partial negative ($\delta-$) charges

              \item These charges interact with the ions in the ionic compound, breaking the lattice apart

            \end{itemize}

          \item Ion-Dipole Interaction

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Positive ions are surrounded by the partial negative charges of water molecules (oxygen)

              \item Negative ions are surrounded by the partial positive charges of water molecules (hydrogen)

            \end{itemize}

          \item Why Polar Solvents are Effective

            \begin{itemize}

              \item The strong dipole moment of water (or other polar solvents) provides the necessary energy to disrupt the ionic lattice

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Hardness and Density

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Hardness of Ionic Compounds

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Ionic compounds are hard because of the strong electrostatic forces holding the ions in a rigid, 3D lattice structure

          \item Displacing ions requires significant energy to overcome these forces

        \end{itemize}

      \item Density of Ionic Compounds

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Ionic lattices are closely packed due to the strong attraction between ions
