\begin{itemize}

  \item Debye Equation for Dielectric Relaxation:

    $$\varepsilon^*(\omega)=\varepsilon'-j\varepsilon''=\varepsilon_{\infty}+\frac{\varepsilon_s+\varepsilon_{\infty}}{1+(j\omega\tau)}$$

  \item Quality Factor, $Q$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The ratio of imaginary to real impedances:

        $$Q=\frac{X}{R}=\frac{1}{2\pi f_s RC}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Inductance

    $$L=\frac{\mu_o\mu_rN^2A}{l}$$

\end{itemize}
